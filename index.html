  <h1 class="text-3xl md:text-4xl font-light mb-4">The First 100 Days: A Practical Guide to Merger Integration</h1>
  <p class="text-gray-500 mb-8">October 2024 • 8 min read</p>

  <p class="mb-4">On Day 0 of a recent deal, the CFO slid a one-pager across the table. “If we hit <em>these</em> numbers, the board will call this a success. Everything else is noise.” That sheet became the north star for the integration. We built the work around it, not the other way around.</p>

  <p class="mb-4">Here’s the rhythm we use. It’s not theatrical. It’s the boring kind of consistent that keeps customers, pays people on time, and makes leaders look like they’ve done this before.</p>

  <h2 class="text-2xl font-light mt-8 mb-3">Day 0: Put a spine in the program</h2>
  <p class="mb-4">Before the ink is dry, we stand up an Integration Management Office with a single cadence and a single source of truth. Finance sits with us, not apart from us. Every workstream lead has a charter tied directly to the value story. Decisions get logged. Risks have owners. We’re not playing whack-a-mole in Slack—there’s a place where the work lives.</p>

  <p class="mb-4">On one life sciences integration, that meant landing the unglamorous basics first: identity and access, payroll continuity, customer communications signed by leaders the market actually knows. By Day 1, employees could badge in, get paid, and explain what was changing in a page or less. It wasn’t flashy. It was confidence-building.</p>

  <h2 class="text-2xl font-light mt-8 mb-3">Days 1–30: Don’t break trust</h2>
  <p class="mb-4">The fastest way to burn credibility is to surprise customers or miss the first payroll. So we don’t. We call top accounts in week one and give them names, not aliases. We hold listening sessions with the people closest to the work and publish a short weekly note to everyone else: what we decided, what’s next, and where to raise a hand.</p>

  <p class="mb-4">In a data & analytics carve-out, we sat the program team next to customer support for two weeks. Patterns emerged by day three—questions we could answer once, clearly, and everywhere. Churn risk dropped because silence disappeared.</p>

  <h2 class="text-2xl font-light mt-8 mb-3">Days 31–60: Choose how the company will actually work</h2>
  <p class="mb-4">This is the window where org design matters. We don’t draw boxes; we design decisions. Who sets price? Who prioritizes the roadmap? Where does information live? We codify spans and layers, write down real RACIs, and place leaders you can trust to say “no” as comfortably as “yes.”</p>

  <p class="mb-4">With one global SAP program, that meant agreeing to a <em>best-of-both</em> model in Finance and an <em>absorb</em> model in Procurement. The choice wasn’t ideological—it was practical, and it unlocked the sequencing for training and cutovers.</p>

  <h2 class="text-2xl font-light mt-8 mb-3">Days 61–100: Show proof, not promises</h2>
  <p class="mb-4">By now we want receipts. A dashboard that shows run-rate value, not just green boxes. A customer-facing improvement you can point to. Managers who can explain—without a slide—what’s different this quarter. When the first system wave lands, we run a command center that behaves like air traffic control: tight checklists, tight handoffs, zero heroics.</p>

  <p class="mb-4">The punchline: no fireworks, just momentum. That’s the job. If you want this kind of integration—measured, humane, on-thesis—<a href="#contact" class="underline">let’s talk</a>.</p>

<div>
  <h1 class="text-3xl md:text-4xl font-light mb-4">Why 70% of Transformations Fail (And How to Be in the 30%)</h1>
  <p class="text-gray-500 mb-8">September 2024 • 6 min read</p>

  <p class="mb-4">I walked into a kickoff where twelve teams each had a beautiful roadmap—and not one shared a definition of “done.” Everyone was busy. Nobody was moving the number the CEO cared about. That’s not rare. It’s fixable.</p>

  <p class="mb-4">Here’s what we do instead, drawn from large ERP programs, carve-outs, and commercial transformations where the value had a deadline.</p>

  <h2 class="text-2xl font-light mt-8 mb-3">Start with a sentence you can say out loud</h2>
  <p class="mb-4">If a director can’t explain the point of the program in one breath—how it makes money, saves money, or reduces risk—we’re not ready to start. We build a one-page value story and tape it to governance. Every update ties back to it. If something doesn’t serve the sentence, it moves to the <em>not now</em> list. Focus is a kindness.</p>

  <h2 class="text-2xl font-light mt-8 mb-3">Give leaders a way to lead</h2>
  <p class="mb-4">Sponsorship isn’t a logo on slide one. It’s behaviors. In practice: a weekly decision SLA, visible walk-abouts with front-line teams, and the courage to kill work that isn’t earning its keep. When leaders do that consistently, resistance melts because people finally see who’s steering.</p>

  <h2 class="text-2xl font-light mt-8 mb-3">Design the work people will actually do</h2>
  <p class="mb-4">Go-lives don’t change outcomes. New behaviors do. We map impacts by role, build training around real scenarios, and equip managers to coach—not just to forward emails. The leading indicators we watch are simple: usage that sticks, proficiency that climbs, and sentiment that stabilizes after the first dip. When those go in the right direction, the financials tend to follow.</p>

  <h2 class="text-2xl font-light mt-8 mb-3">Run governance that earns trust</h2>
  <p class="mb-4">Good governance is mercifully boring. One RAID, one decisions log, one cadence. No shadow meetings. We show red when it’s red and make it very clear who is driving it back to green. Finance sits in the room so the story is about value, not vibes.</p>

  <p class="mb-4">If you’re staring at a program that feels heavy and oddly hollow at the same time, we can help you put the weight where it belongs—on results, on people, and on choices that compound. <a href="#contact" class="underline">Start a conversation</a>.</p>
